Application created with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [SailboatUI](https://sailboatui.com/) to demonstrate Svelte development.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

It will generate a build folder.

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

You can run the project in production with:

```bash
node build/index.js
```
